üí° Concept:
‚ÄúPer cent‚Äù means per hundred.
E.g., 25% = 25/100 = 0.25

üîë Key Formulas:
| Concept                  | Formula                                              |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| % value                  | Part/Whole * 100                                     |
| % increase               | Increase/Original * 100                              |
| % decrease               | Decrease/Original * 100                                |
| Successive % change      |  x + y + xy/100                                      |
| Converting % to fraction | e.g., 25% = 1/4, 20% = 1/5                           |

üß† Example 1 (Easy):
If a number is increased by 25%, what is the new number if original was 120?
New=120+25%of120 = 120+30 = 150

üß† Example 2 (Conceptual):
If A's income is 20% more than B's, then how much % is B's income less than A‚Äôs?
Let B = ‚Çπ100 ‚Üí A = ‚Çπ120
So, B is (20/120)*100 = 16.67% less than A
üìù Note: % increase and % decrease are not symmetric

üß† Example 3 (GATE/CSAT Style):
If the price of a commodity increases by 25%, by how much % should the consumption be reduced so that the expenditure remains same?
Use:  %¬†decrease¬†in¬†consumption=  x/(100+x) * 100  Where x is the % increase in price
So here,
(25/125)√ó100=20%

üîÑ Similarly:
If price decreases by x%, to keep expenditure constant,
consumption must increase, and the formula becomes:
%¬†increase¬†in¬†consumption= x/(100-x) * 100
