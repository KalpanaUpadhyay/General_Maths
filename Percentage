💡 Concept:
“Per cent” means per hundred.
E.g., 25% = 25/100 = 0.25

| Concept                  | Formula                                              |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| % value                  | Part/Whole * 100                                     |
| % increase               | Increase/Original * 100                              |
| % decrease               | Decrease/Original 100                                |
| Successive % change      |  x + y + xy/100                                      |
| Converting % to fraction | e.g., 25% = 1/4, 20% = 1/5                           |

🧠 Example 1 (Easy):
If a number is increased by 25%, what is the new number if original was 120?
New=120+25%of120 = 120+30 = 150

🧠 Example 2 (Conceptual):
If A's income is 20% more than B's, then how much % is B's income less than A’s?
Let B = ₹100 → A = ₹120
So, B is 20/120*100 = 16.67% less than A
📝 Note: % increase and % decrease are not symmetric

🧠 Example 3 (GATE/CSAT Style):
If the price of a commodity increases by 25%, by how much % should the consumption be reduced so that the expenditure remains same?
Use:  % decrease in consumption=  x/100+x * 100  Where x is the % increase in price
So here,
25/125×100=20%

🔄 Similarly:
If price decreases by x%, to keep expenditure constant,
consumption must increase, and the formula becomes:
% increase in consumption= x/100-x * 100
