💡 Concept:
“Per cent” means per hundred.
E.g., 25% = 25/100 = 0.25

| Concept                  | Formula                                              |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| % value                  | Part/Whole * 100                                     |
| % increase               | Increase/Original * 100                              |
| % decrease               | Decrease/Original * 100                                |
| Successive % change      |  x + y + xy/100                                      |
| Converting % to fraction | e.g., 25% = 1/4, 20% = 1/5                           |

🧠 Example 1 (Easy):
If a number is increased by 25%, what is the new number if original was 120?
New=120+25%of120 = 120+30 = 150

🧠 Example 2 (Conceptual):
If A's income is 20% more than B's, then how much % is B's income less than A’s?
Let B = ₹100 → A = ₹120
So, B is (20/120)*100 = 16.67% less than A
📝 Note: % increase and % decrease are not symmetric

🧠 Example 3 (GATE/CSAT Style):
If the price of a commodity increases by 25%, by how much % should the consumption be reduced so that the expenditure remains same?
Use:  % decrease in consumption=  x/(100+x) * 100  Where x is the % increase in price
So here,
(25/125)×100=20%

🔄 Similarly:
If price decreases by x%, to keep expenditure constant,
consumption must increase, and the formula becomes:
% increase in consumption= x/(100-x) * 100

| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Basic Definition                                | Percentage = (Part / Whole) × 100                                            | 30 out of 50 → (30/50)×100 = 60%               |
| 2. Conversion                                      | Fraction ⇄ Percentage ⇄ Decimal                                              | ¼ = 25%, 0.25 = 25%                            |
| 3. Increase/Decrease                               | x% increase: New = Old × (1 + x/100)<br>x% decrease: New = Old × (1 - x/100) | 100 increased by 10% → 110                     |
| 4. Successive Changes                              | Successive % formula: (x + y + xy/100)                                       | +20% then +10% → 32%                           |
| 5. % Change Formula                                | % change = ((new - old)/old) × 100                                           | 120 to 150 → 25% increase                      |
| 6. Comparison                                      | A is what % more/less than B?                                                | A = 60, B = 40 → A is 50% more                 |
| 7. Reverse Percentage                              | Finding base from percentage                                                 | 80 is 20% of what? → 80×100/20 = 400           |
| 8. Population Based %                              | Population after x years with rate r%                                        | P = P₀ × (1 ± r/100)ⁿ                          |
| 9. Application in Profit & Loss, DI, Marks, Salary | Percent based application problems                                           | Find selling price, marks increased by x% etc. |
