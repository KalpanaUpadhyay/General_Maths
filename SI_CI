🏦 Simple Interest (SI) & Compound Interest (CI)
These are core topics in banking/finance-related exams and regularly appear in CSAT, SSC, Railways, etc.

🔹 1. Simple Interest (SI)
✅ Formula:
SI = 𝑃*R*T/100
Where:
P = Principal
R = Rate of Interest (% per annum)
T = Time (in years)

Total Amount (A)=P+SI

 2. Compound Interest (CI)
Interest is calculated on principal + previous interest each year.

✅ Formula:
Amount (A) P*(1+R/100)^T
CI = A-P

🧠 Difference Between SI and CI:
| SI                       | CI                            |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Same interest every year | Interest increases every year |
| Easier to compute        | Slightly complex              |
| Used in normal loans     | Used in banks/investments     |

📘 Example 1 – SI:
Q. Find the simple interest on ₹1000 at 10% per annum for 3 years.

SI = 1000*10*3/100 = 300

📘 Example 2 – CI:
Q. Find compound interest on ₹1000 at 10% for 2 years.

𝐴 =1000×(1+10/100)^2
=
1000×(1.1)^2
= 1210


A=1000×(1+ 100/10)^2
 =1000×(1.1)^2
 =1210

CI=1210−1000=₹210


🔄 Shortcut Trick for CI (2 years):
CI=𝑃×(𝑅/100+(𝑅/100)^2)

Example:

CI=1000×(0.10+0.01)=₹210
