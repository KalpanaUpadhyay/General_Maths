| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Cost Price (CP)**    | Price at which item is bought |
| **Selling Price (SP)** | Price at which item is sold   |
| **Profit**             | $\text{SP} - \text{CP}$       |
| **Loss**               | $\text{CP} - \text{SP}$       |


âœ… Key Formulas
| Condition        | Formula                                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Profit %         | Profit/CP * 100                                  |
| Loss %           | Loss/CP * 100                                    |
| SP (if profit %) | SP = CP *(1 + P/100)                             |
| SP (if loss %)   | SP = CP * (1 - L/100)                            |
| CP (if profit %) | CP = SP / (1 + P/100)                            |
| CP (if loss %)   | CP = SP / (1 - L/100)               |


ðŸ§  Quick Examples
ðŸ“˜ Example 1:
A shopkeeper buys an item for â‚¹200 and sells it for â‚¹250. Find profit %.
Profit = 250-200 = 50
Profit% = 50/200*100 = 25%

ðŸ“Œ Shortcut Tricks (for Exams)
If SP = k% of CP, then profit/loss % = k âˆ’ 100

When CP and SP are reversed, % profit and % loss are equal.
E.g., buy at â‚¹100, sell at â‚¹80 â†’ 20% loss
If you buy at â‚¹80 and sell at â‚¹100 â†’ 25% profit!
